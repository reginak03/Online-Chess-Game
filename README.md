# Online chess game

## Description
This project consists of building an online chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create an interactive 2-player chess game that works in the browser, using only local technologies — no servers are required. Players should be able to move pieces according to chess rules, restart games, and track whose turn it is.

The chess board will be generated dynamically with JavaScript, and all the logic — including legal move detection, check/checkmate logic, turn switching, and move history — must be implemented in JavaScript. The game runs completely in the browser and does not require any backend.

## Tasks
- do the remaining 3 vids for other rules.
- Implement a move history panel.
- Highlight pieces when check/checkmate happens
- play with AI
- Final testing. Create README with instructions and screenshots. Submit as Git repo.
