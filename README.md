# Online chess game

## Description
This project consists of building an online chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create an interactive 2-player chess game that works in the browser, using only local technologies — no servers are required. Players should be able to move pieces according to chess rules, restart games, and track whose turn it is.

The chess board will be generated dynamically with JavaScript, and all the logic — including legal move detection, check/checkmate logic, turn switching, and move history — must be implemented in JavaScript. The game runs completely in the browser and does not require any backend.


## Tasks
-TOMORROW:
- Dynamically generate the board using JavaScript.
- Implement logic for:
	Valid moves per piece
	Turn switching
	Check and checkmate detection
	Illegal move prevention
- Style the board and pieces using CSS or image assets.

AFTER:
- Allow restart/reset of the game.
- Show captured pieces.
- Implement a move history panel.
- Display which player's turn it is.
- Highlight legal moves when a piece is selected.
- Final testing. Create README with instructions and screenshots. Submit as Git repo.
